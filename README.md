36 hour-online hackathon project 
# CarbonTrack 🌱

## Project Overview
CarbonTrack is a simple web-based prototype that helps users estimate their carbon footprint based on daily expenses.

This project was developed during a 36-hour online hackathon by first-year Computer Science students.

---

## Problem Statement
Individuals want to reduce their carbon footprint but lack visibility into how their daily spending impacts the environment.

---

## Proposed Solution
The user enters an expense amount and selects a category such as food, travel, or shopping.  
Based on predefined emission factors, the system calculates an estimated carbon footprint and provides a simple suggestion to reduce environmental impact.

## How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser
3. Enter expense details and click **Calculate Footprint**
